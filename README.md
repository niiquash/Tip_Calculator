# Overview

This is a simple tip calculator application written in Kotlin

The app asks the user to provide an initial bill amount and then asks for the percentage tip they want to pay.
The program then calls functions to calculate the tip amount, and then adds every paid tip to a list for record keeping.

I wrote this program to learn the basics of Kotlin, in preparation for developing android programs.

Here's a link to my YouTuve demo on how the app works.
